Before，we've conbined an ALU、control unit、some memory、and a clock together to make a basic, but functional CPU

CPU 之所以强大，是因为它是可编程的，this means if you write a different sequence of instructions, then the CPU will perform a different task.

So the CPU is a piece of hardware which is controlled by easy-to-modify software.

Now it's time to give our CPU some actual instructions to process !

In 1971, Intel released [the 4004 processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_4004), it was the first CPU put all into a single chip.

It supported 46 instructions, which was enough to build an entire working computer.

现代 CPU 有上千种指令，比如 an Intel Core i7, ranging from 1 to 15 bytes long.

And for example, there's over a dozens different opcodes just for variants of `ADD` !

指令越来越多，是因为给 CPU 设计了越来越多的功能

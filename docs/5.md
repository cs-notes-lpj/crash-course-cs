之前，我们仅用逻辑门，就造了一个简单的 ALU，它能执行算术运算和逻辑运算

当然，如果计算出结果后就把结果扔掉了，那这就没多大意义了

想办法把算出来的结果存起来，这才更有意义

That's where computer memory comes in !

If you've ever been in the middle of a long RPG campaign on your console, or slogging through a difficult level on Minesweeper on your desktop, and your dog came by, tripped and pulled the power cord out of the wall, you know the agony of losing all your progress.

The reason for your loss is that your console, your laptop and your computers make use of「Random Access Memory」, RAM for short.——随机存取存储器 which stores things like game state - as long as the power stays on.

Another type of memory, called persistent memory, can survive without power, and it's used for different things. We'll talk about the persistence of memory in a later essay.

Now, we're going to start small - literally by building a circuit that can store one... single... bit of information !

After that, we'll scale up, and build our very own memory module !

And we'll combine it with our ALU, when we finally build our very own CPU !

### let's begin

All of the logic circuits we've discussed so far go in one direction - always flowing forward.

But what will happen if we create circuits that loop back on themselves ?

---

let's try taking an OR gate and feed the output back into one of it's inputs.

First, let's set both inputs to `0`, obviously, this circuit always outputs `0`

If we were to flip input A to `1`, obviously, this circuit always outputs `1`, and if we flip input A back to `0`, the OR gate still outputs `1`

So now we've got a circuit that records a `1` for us.

But we've got a tiny problem - this change is permanent ! This means no matter how hard we try, there's no way to get this circuit to flip back from a `1` to a `0`.

---

Now let's look at the same circuit, but with an AND gate instead.

We'll start inputs A and B both at `1`.

If we flip input A to `0`, then the output will go to `0`

同理，this circuit records a `0` for us.

---

现在有了能存 1 和 0 的电路，the key to making this a useful piece of memory is to combine these two circuts into what is called「the AND-OR Latch」

中文可译作 => AND-OR 锁存器

It has two inputs

- a「set」input, which sets the output to a `1`

- a「reset」input, which resets the output to a `0`

    ![20221206175616](https://aliyun-oss-lpj.oss-cn-qingdao.aliyuncs.com/images/by-clipboard/20221206175616.png)

- If set and reset are both `0`, the circuit just outputs whatever was last put in it.（把这里的 it 抽象地理解为 1 bit 内存，这样有助于理解）此外，这个特性就得益于之前说到过的存 1 和 0 的两个电路的 change 都是 permanent 的.

#### 小结

既然我们能控制让 output 输出 1 或 0，也能通过同时将 set 和 reset 都设置为 0 来从 output 读取之前设置的 1 bit 信息（In other words, it remembers a single bit of information !），那这个电路不就实现了 1 bit 信息的 memory 嘛 ！

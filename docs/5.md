之前，我们仅用逻辑门，就造了一个简单的 ALU，它能执行算术运算和逻辑运算

当然，如果计算出结果后就把结果扔掉了，那这就没多大意义了

得想办法把算出来的结果存起来，这才更有意义

That's where computer memory comes in !

If you've ever been in the middle of a long RPG campaign on your console, or slogging through a difficult level on Minesweeper on your desktop, and your dog came by, tripped and pulled the power cord out of the wall, you know the agony of losing all your progress.

The reason for your loss is that your console, your laptop and your computers make use of「Random Access Memory」, RAM for short.——随机存取存储器 which stores things like game state - as long as the power stays on.

Another type of memory, called persistent memory, can survive without power, and it's used for different things. We'll talk about the persistence of memory in a later essay.

Now, we're going to start small - literally by building a circuit that can store one... single... bit of information !

After that, we'll scale up, and build our very own memory module !

And we'll combine it with our ALU, when we finally build our very own CPU !

### let's begin

All of the logic circuits we've discussed so far go in one direction - always flowing forward.

But what will happen if we create circuits that loop back on themselves ?

---

let's try taking an OR gate and feed the output back into one of it's inputs.

First, let's set both inputs to `0`, obviously, this circuit always outputs `0`

If we were to flip input A to `1`, obviously, this circuit always outputs `1`, and if we flip input A back to `0`, the OR gate still outputs `1`

So now we've got a circuit that records a `1` for us.

But we've got a tiny problem - this change is permanent ! This means no matter how hard we try, there's no way to get this circuit to flip back from a `1` to a `0`.

---

Now let's look at the same circuit, but with an AND gate instead.

We'll start inputs A and B both at `1`.

If we flip input A to `0`, then the output will go to `0`

同理，this circuit records a `0` for us.

---

现在有了能存 1 和 0 的电路，the key to making this a useful piece of memory ( means rewritable and readable ) is to combine these two circuts into what is called「the AND-OR latch」，即：AND-OR 锁存器

Tips: 由于要设计的 1 bit memory 应该默认为 0，能存 1，所以先放 OR gate

The AND-OR latch has two inputs

- a「set」input, which sets the output to a `1` (set=1, reset=0)

- a「reset」input, which resets the output to a `0` (reset=1)

    ![20221206175616](https://aliyun-oss-lpj.oss-cn-qingdao.aliyuncs.com/images/by-clipboard/20221206175616.png)

- ok, 我们实现了 rewritable, 接下来实现 readable

- If set and reset are both `0`, the circuit just outputs whatever was last put in it.

- ok, 我们实现了 readable ！换言之，我们实现了 1 bit 的 memory ！

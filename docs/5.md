之前，我们仅用逻辑门，就造了一个简单的 ALU，它能执行算术运算和逻辑运算

当然，如果计算出结果后就把结果扔掉了，那这就没多大意义了

想办法把算出来的结果存起来，这才更有意义

and may be even run several operations in a row. (这句话暂时看不懂没关系，继续向下看就行)

That's where computer memory comes in !

If you've ever been in the middle of a long RPG campaign on your console, or slogging through a difficult level on Minesweeper on your desktop, and your dog came by, tripped and pulled the power cord out of the wall, you know the agony of losing all your progress.

The reason for your loss is that your console, your laptop and your computers make use of「Random Access Memory」, RAM for short.——随机存取存储器 which stores things like game state - as long as the power stays on.

Another type of memory, called persistent memory, can survive without power, and it's used for different things. We'll talk about the persistence of memory in a later essay.

Now, we're going to start small - literally by building a circuit that can store one... single... bit of information !

After that, we'll scale up, and build our very own memory module !

And we'll combine it with our ALU, when we finally build our very own CPU !

We've already made a ALU, which takes in binary numbers and performs calculations

![20221208095212](https://aliyun-oss-lpj.oss-cn-qingdao.aliyuncs.com/images/by-clipboard/20221208095212.png)

and we've made two types of computer memory:

    Registers —— small, linear chunks of memory, useful for storing a single value

    and then we scaled up, and made some RAM —— a larger bank of memory that can store a lot of numbers located at different addresses.

Now it's time to put it all together and build ourselves the heart of any computer —— the CPU ( the Central Processing Unit )

### CPU 的功能

A CPU's job is to execute programs which are made up of a series of individual operations called instructions, because they "instruct" the computer what to do.

![20221208101959](https://aliyun-oss-lpj.oss-cn-qingdao.aliyuncs.com/images/by-clipboard/20221208101959.png)

If these are mathematical instructions, like add or subtract, the CPU will configure its ALU to do the mathematical operation.

Or it might be a memory instruction, in which case the CPU will talk with memory to read and write values.

### 那我们如何构建我们的 CPU 呢

There are lots of parts in a CPU, so we're going to lay it out piece by piece, building up as we go.

We'll focus on functional blocks, rather than showing every sigle wire. This means when we do connect two components with a line, this is an abstraction for all of the necessary wires. This high level view is called「the microarchitecture」微体系架构

### 一些准备工作

We know that data and programs can be stored in memory as binary values, thus obviously, we need some memory.

Let's drop in the RAM module we created before, and to keep things simple, we'll assume it only has 16 memory locations, each containing 8 bits.

As an example, we've initialized our RAM with a simple computer program that we'll go through today.

---

And we need 6 registers to complete our CPU which will be used to temporarily store and manipulate values.

First, we need a register to keep track of where we are in a program. For this, we use an「instruction address register」which as the name suggests, stores the memory address of the current instruction.

小声bb：这个寄存器好 tm 像指针啊 ！

And then we need another register to store the current instruction which we'll called「the instruction register」.

When we first boot up our computer, all of our registers start at `0`

### Let's begin to build our CPU

> 不过是将我们之前实现的组件们拼装到一起，实现「向 CPU 发指令，CPU 根据指令做事情」罢了

指令长什么样子呢 ？

Firstly, we can assin an ID to each instruction supported by our CPU, in our hypothetical example below, we use the first four bits to store the "operation code" or "opcode" for short and the final four bits specify where the data for that operation should come from. ( could be registers or an address in memory )

![20221208120808](https://aliyun-oss-lpj.oss-cn-qingdao.aliyuncs.com/images/by-clipboard/20221208120808.png)

### The fetch phase

The first phase of a CPU's operation is called「the fetch phase」, this is where we retrieve our first instruction.

First, we wire our「Instruction Address Register」to our RAM module, the register's value is 0, so the RAM returns whatever value is stored in address 0, in this case, 00101110. Then this value is copied into our「instruction register」

![20221208154842](https://aliyun-oss-lpj.oss-cn-qingdao.aliyuncs.com/images/by-clipboard/20221208154842.png)

Now that we've fetched an instruction from memory, we need to figure out what that instruction is so we can execute it. This is called「the decode phase」

In this case, the "opcode", which is the first four bits, is: 0010, this "opcode" corresponds to the「LOAD_A」instruction, which loads a value from RAM into register A.

![20221208160805](https://aliyun-oss-lpj.oss-cn-qingdao.aliyuncs.com/images/by-clipboard/20221208160805.png)

The RAM address is the last four bits of our instruction which are 1110, or 14 in decimal.

![20221208160937](https://aliyun-oss-lpj.oss-cn-qingdao.aliyuncs.com/images/by-clipboard/20221208160937.png)

Instructions are decoded and interpreted by a Control Unit, like everything else we've built, it is made out of logic gates either.

For example, to recognize a「LOAD_A」instruction, we need a circuit that checks if the opcode matches 0010, which we can do with a handful of logic gates.

![20221208161555](https://aliyun-oss-lpj.oss-cn-qingdao.aliyuncs.com/images/by-clipboard/20221208161555.png)

### The execute phase

Now that we know what instruction we're dealing with, we can go ahead and perform that instruction which is the begining of execute phase !

Using the output of our LOAD_A checking circuit, we can turn on the RAM's read enable line and send in address 14, then the RAM retrieves the value at that address , which is 00000011, or 3 in decimal.

![20221208162354](https://aliyun-oss-lpj.oss-cn-qingdao.aliyuncs.com/images/by-clipboard/20221208162354.png)

Now, because this is a LOAD_A instruction, we want that value to only be saved into register A and not any of the other registers.

So if we connect the RAM's data wires to our four data registers, we can use our LOAD_A check circuit to enable the write enable only for register A, and there you have it !

![20221208162911](https://aliyun-oss-lpj.oss-cn-qingdao.aliyuncs.com/images/by-clipboard/20221208162911.png)

We've successfully loaded the value at RAM address 14 into register A.

We've completed the instruction, so we can turn all of our wires off and we are ready to fetch the next instruction in memory. To do this, we increment the Instruction Address Register by 1 which completes the execute phase.

### The control unit

LOAD_A is just one of several possible instructions that our CPU can execute. Different instructions are decoded by different logic circuits which configured the CPU's components to perform that action.

Looking at all those individual decode circuits is too much detail, so since we looked at one example, we're going to go ahead and package them all up as a single「Control Unit」to keep things simple. A new level of abstruction !

![20221208164232](https://aliyun-oss-lpj.oss-cn-qingdao.aliyuncs.com/images/by-clipboard/20221208164232.png)

The control unit is comparable to the conductor of an orchestra, directing all of the different parts of the CPU. Having completed one full ( fetch/decode/execute ) cycle, we are ready to start all over again, begining with the fetch phase.

让我们快进到取第 3 条指令，这条指令有点不同，10000100, that "opcode" 1000 is an ADD instruction, and instead of an 4-bits RAM address, this instruction uses two sets of 2-bits. Remember that 2-bits can encode 4 values, so 2-bits is enough to select any one of our 4 registers.

The first set of 2-bits is 01, which in this case corresponds to register B, and 00, which is register A.

So, "1000 01 00" is the instruction for adding the value in register B into the value in register A.

So to execute this instruction, we need to integrate the ALU we made before into our CPU.

![20221208170835](https://aliyun-oss-lpj.oss-cn-qingdao.aliyuncs.com/images/by-clipboard/20221208170835.png)

The control unit is responsible for selecting the right registers to pass in as inputs and configuring the ALU to perform the right operation.

So for this ADD instruction, the control unit enables register B and feeds its value into the first input of the ALU. It also enables register A and feeds it into the second ALU input.

As we already discussed, the ALU itself can perform several different operations, so the control unit must configure it to perform an ADD operation by passing in the ADD "opcode".

![20221208171631](https://aliyun-oss-lpj.oss-cn-qingdao.aliyuncs.com/images/by-clipboard/20221208171631.png)

Finally, the output should be saved into register A but it can't be written directly because the new value would ripple back into the ALU and then keep adding to itself. So the control unit uses an internal register to temporarily save the output, turn off the ALU, and then write the value into the proper destination register.

和之前一样，最后一件事也是把 INST.ADDR.REGISTER 加 1

### 小结

恭喜 ！本文运行了第一个电脑程序 ！

它从内存中加载两个值，相加，然后把结果写回内存

运行步骤就是不断循环 “取指令 => 解码 => 执行(最后一步是 INST.ADDR.REGISTER 加 1)”

### The clock

上文我们是手动管理 CPU 执行程序的节奏，但真正管理 CPU 执行程序的节奏的是一个叫做时钟（clock）的组件

the clock triggers an electrical signal at a precise and regular interval, its signal is used by the control unit to advance the internal operation of the CPU, keeping everything in lock-step.

就像罗马帆船的船头，有一个人负责按节奏地击鼓，让所有划船的人同步，就像节拍器一样。

当然，节奏不能太快，因为就算是电，也是需要一定时间来传输的

CPU "取指令 => 解码 => 执行" 完成每一步的速度叫做时钟速度（CLOCK SPEED）单位是赫兹（HERTZ），一个用于表示频率的单位，1 赫兹表示每秒一个周期

因为本文花费大概 6 分钟讲解了 4 条指令（LOAD、LOAD、ADD、STORE）

所以时钟速度是：4 * 3 / ( 6 * 60 ) 约为 0.03 赫兹

拥有了时钟的 CPU 才是完整的，现在可以将 CPU 抽象成一个独立组件 ！

### 小结

世界上第一个单芯片 CPU 是 the Intel 4004，它的时钟速度达到了 740 千赫兹（每秒 74 万次），但也远不及当今的 CPU（当今达到了几十亿甚至上百亿赫兹）

发布于 1971

是一个 4-bits CPU

它的微体系架构就很像我们刚设计的这个 CPU

你可能听过有人会把计算机超频，意思就是修改时钟速度，加快 CPU 的速度，就像罗马帆船要撞击另一艘船时，鼓手会加快敲鼓速度。芯片制造商通常会给 CPU 留一些余地，接受一点点超频，但超频太多会让 CPU 过热，或者产生乱码，因为电信号跟不上时钟

你可能没听过降频，但其实降频很有用，因为有时候没必要让 CPU 全速运行（可能用户走开了，或者正在跑一个性能要求较低的程序），把 CPU 的时钟速度放慢，能够节省很多电，这就从技术上延长了你电脑的续航时间。

很多现代处理器就实现了智能降频，which is called「dynamic frequency scaling」动态调节频率
